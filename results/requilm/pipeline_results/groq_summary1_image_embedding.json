The sequence begins with an older person drinking coffee, followed by a close-up of a glass jar filled with a white substance. The narrative then shifts to a person pouring flour into a bowl, and subsequently, two faces are superimposed on each other. The story continues with a person's mouth and tongue, an older woman sorting pills, and a person holding a small piece of money. The sequence also features a person smoking a cigarette, holding various small objects, and a close-up of a blue object.
