The story begins with a intense sword fight between two people in medieval costumes. The scene then shifts to a calm and focused atmosphere, where the main character is seen sitting on the ground, wearing a white robe and holding a pipe. He then appears in another scene, holding a stick and sitting near a window, possibly posing for a picture. The story then takes a dramatic turn, with the main character seen holding a sword, standing in a room with a tapestry on the wall. He is then shown in a defensive stance, kneeling on the ground and holding a sword. The story builds up to a dramatic and intense moment, where the main character is seen standing in a dark stage, ready for action. The final scene shows another intense sword fight, similar to the first scene, suggesting that the story has come full circle.
